            <h3>Here's a biography of King of Pop:</h3>
            <p>
                Michael Jackson wasn't merely the biggest pop star of his era,
                shaping the sound and Style of the 1970s and '80s; he was one of
                the defining stars of the 20th century, a musician who changed the
                contours of American culture. A preternaturally gifted Singer and
                dancer, Jackson first rose to stardom in 1969 as the 11-year-old
                frontman for his family's band, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">the Jackson
                    5</a>. As remarkable a run
                as <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">Jackson 5</a> had at the dawn of the '70s,
                each of their first
                four singles went to number one and they stayed near the top of the
                charts for the next five years it all served as a preamble to
                Jackson's solo career. Off the Wall, the dazzling 1979 album co-
                produced by <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, announced Jackson as
                a mature talent,
                and the singles "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough" and "Rock with
                You" turned it into a blockbuster. Despite its success, Jackson
                believed Off the Wall was pigeonholed as an R&B record.
                Determined to break through this glass ceiling, he reunited with
                Jones to create Thriller, the 1982 album that shattered every music
                record on the books. Thriller was designed to appeal to every
                audience and its diversity was evident by its guests: he enlisted
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_van_Halen">Eddie Van Halen</a> to play guitar on the hard
                rock of "Beat It" while
                inviting <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> to duet on the
                chipper soft pop tune "The
                Girl Is Mine." Jackson also expanded the horizons of soul and dance
                music, producing pioneering masterpieces like "Billie Jean." This
                single provided Thriller with its 1983 breakthrough, thanks in part to
                its groundbreaking music video, which became the first clip from a
                Black artist to enter steady rotation on the fledgling MTV. Jackson's
                smashing of the network's racial barriers was only one aspect of
                Thriller's unprecedented crossover. Seven of its nine songs were
                Top Ten hits, it earned eight Grammy Awards, and topped the
                Billboard charts for 37 weeks, matching its American success
                internationally to become the biggest-selling album of all time,
                earning 32 platinum certifications in the U.S. and moving over 100
                million albums worldwide. Such a phenomenal triumph pushed
                Jackson into the stratosphere and Bad the eagerly-anticipated
                1987 sequel to Thriller, co-produced once again with <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy
                    Jones</a>
                kept him there, generating five number one singles on the
                Billboard charts and selling 30 million copies internationally, two
                thirds of which were outside of the U.S. Jackson parted ways with
                Jones for 1991's Dangerous, another global blockbuster. HIStory, a
                1995 double-disc set that paired a disc of hits with a new album,
                produced a couple of international number one singles. Invincible,
                his 2001 album, turned out to be his last. Health problems
                culminated in his untimely death in the summer of 2009, but at that
                point Jackson's legend was safe: he stood alongside <a

                and <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> as one of the musicians that created
                the sound of

            <p>
                Such heights came from modest beginnings. Michael was born in
                Gary, Indiana on August 29, 1958, the fifth son of Katherine and Joe
                Jackson. His mother was a Jehovah's Witness and his father a
                former boxer turned steelworker who played guitar on the side.
                Harboring aspirations of musical stardom, Joe shepherded his sons
                into a musical act around 1962. At that point, it was just the three
                eldest children <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Jackson">Tito</a>, <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Jackson">Jackie</a>, and <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Jackson">Jermaine</a> but Michael joined
                them in 1964 and soon dominated the group. Stealing moves from
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown">James Brown</a> and <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Wilson">Jackie Wilson</a>, Michael became
                the epicenter of
                the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">Jackson 5</a> as they earned accolades at
                local talent shows and
                went on to play soul clubs throughout the Midwest, working their
                way toward the East Coast in 1967 where they won an amateur
                contest at the Apollo Theater. Returning to Gary, the group cut a
                pair of singles for the local imprint Steeltown in 1968 "(I'm A) Big
                Boy," "We Don't Have to Be Over 21" but their big break arrived
                when they opened for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Taylor_%26_the_Vancouvers">Bobby
                    Taylor & the Vancouvers</a> at Chicago's
                Regal Theater. Impressed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Taylor_%26_the_Vancouvers">Bobby
                    Taylor & the Vancouvers</a> brought them to the attention of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_Gordy">Berry Gordy, Jr</a>., who signed the group to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a>
                in March 1969
                and then sent them out to Los Angeles, where he helped
                mastermind their national launch.
            </p>
            <p>
                "l Want You Back," a song written and produced by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a>'s
                new
                crew the Corporation, saw release in October 1968 when Michael
                Jackson was just 11 years Old. By January 1970, "l Want You Back"
                rocketed to number one on both the pop and R&B charts, and the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">Jackson 5</a> became a sensation, crossing
                over from R&B to AM pop
                radio with ease. Two more hits followed --" ABC" and "The Love
                You Save," both exuberant bubblegum soul before "1'11 Be There"
                revealed Michael's facility with ballads. All three of these sequels
                went to number one and, striking while the iron was hot, Motown spun Michael off into a solo act. His
                first solo single, "Got to Be
                There," arrived at the end of 1971, reaching number four on the
                Billboard Hot 100, and then a cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Day">Bobby Day</a>'s
                chestnut
                "Rockin' Robin" peaked at two in early 1972. Later that year, "Ben,"
                the title theme ballad to an exploitation movie about a killer rat,
                earned Jackson his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Song
                (he would lose).
            </p>
            <p>
                Not long afterward, the careers of both Michael and the <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">Jackson 5</a>
                slowed, victims of shifting tastes, adolescence, and creative battles
                with their label. One last hit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a> arrived in
                1974 "Dancing
                Machine," a single that brought the group in line with the disco
                explosion before the group departed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a> for <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records">Epic</a>
                in 1975.
                With the new label came a new name, along with a slight lineup
                change: <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Jackson">Jermaine</a> stayed at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a> to pursue
                a solo career and
                younger brother Randy took his place. Following a pair of albums
                produced by Philly soul mainstays Gamble & Huff, Michael
                emerged as the group's creative director on 1978's Destiny, co-
                writing their 1979 smash "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"
                with Randy. By that point, Michael had already made a considerable
                solo impression by starring as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, Sidney
                Lumet's 1978 musical adaptation of The Wizard of Oz. Working on
                the soundtrack a record highlighted by his duet with <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Ross">Diana
                    Ross</a>
                on "Ease on Down the Road" he met producer <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy
                    Jones</a>,
                a
                titan of jazz and pop in the '50s and '60s who had yet to score a
                smash in the '70s. The pair hit it off and decided to work on
                Jackson's next solo endeavor, but first the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">the
                    Jackson 5</a> released
                Destiny, which raised the profile of both the band and Michael
                himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this was preamble to Off the Wall, the 1979 album that
                definitively established Michael Jackson as a force of his own.
                Collaborating with producer Jones and songwriter <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Temperton">Rod
                    Temperton</a>,
                Jackson consciously attempted to appeal to multiple audiences
                with Off the Wall, turning the album into a dazzling showcase of all
                his different sounds and skills. Anchored by a pair of number one
                hits the incandescent "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough" and "Rock
                with You" the record turned into a smash, peaking at four on the
                Billboard 200, selling millions of copies as it raked in awards, but
                losing the grand prize of Album of the Year at the Grammy's, leaving
                Jackson with the lingering impression that he needed to cross over
                into the pop mainstream with greater force. Before he could do
                that, he had to complete one more <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">Jackson
                    5</a> album: 1980's
                Triumph, a record with three hit singles ("Lovely One," "This Place
                Hotel," "Can You Feel It") whose title seemed to allude to Michael's
                solo success and certainly benefitted from his heightened stardom.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Triumph, Jackson reunited with producer
                Jones and
                songwriter <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Temperton">Temperton</a> to create the sequel
                to Off the Wall, crafting
                a record that deliberately hit every mark in the musical mainstream.
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> was brought in to underscore
                Michael's soft rock
                leanings, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_van_Halen">Eddie Van Halen</a> pushed Jackson
                into metallic hard rock,
                and the remainder of the album glided from disco to pop to soul in
                an effortless display of his range. "The Girl Is Mine," the first single
                from Thriller, didn't suggest its adventure Jackson played it safe
                by releasing the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">McCartney</a> duet as the
                album's lead but the
                second single, "Billie Jean," forged ahead into new, unnameable
                territory. "Billie Jean" was a pop explosion, topping the charts in
                the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada. Some of its success can no
                doubt be credited to its striking music video, the first to break the
                fledgling MTV's then-unspoken racial barrier; after Jackson, the
                network began playing more Black acts. Some of the single's
                success is due to his sensational performance on <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a>'s
                25th
                anniversary special (Motown 25: Yesterday, Today,
                Forever) in
                1983, a performance aired on May 16, 1983 where Jackson
                unveiled his signature moonwalk dance a move that made it
                appear as if he was gliding backward and announced himself to
                the world as a mature talent. "Beat It," accompanied by an equally
                cinematic video, turned into an equally huge smash on MTV and
                helped push Thriller into the stratosphere. "Wanna Be Startin'
                Somethin'," "Human Nature," and "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" kept
                Thriller at number one and its last single was an extravaganza, with
                Jackson letting director John Landis turn the song into a short
                musical horror film. By the time the album wrapped up its two-year run on the charts,
                it had racked up 37 weeks at number one and sold 29 million copies, becoming the biggest-selling album
                ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even as Thriller was something of a pop perpetual motion machine,
                selling records of its own accord, Jackson worked hard. He once
                again teamed with <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, singing
                "Say Say Say" for
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">McCartney</a>'s 1983 album Pipes of Peace, and he
                reunited with
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">the Jackson 5</a> for 1984's Victory, supporting
                the album with an
                international tour. Prior to its launch, Jackson suffered a serious
                accident while filming a Pepsi commercial designed to accompany
                the tour. During the shoot, pyrotechnics burned Jackson's head,
                sending him to the hospital with second-degree burns to his scalp;
                as he recovered, he started using pain killers for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackson earned accolades for his philanthropic work, especially his
                collaboration with <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie">Lionel Richie</a> on the 1985
                charity single "We Are
                the World," but along with these positive notes, wild stories began
                to circulate in the tabloids. Some further bad press accompanied
                his acquisition of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon">Lennon</a> and <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">McCartney</a>
                songwriting catalog
                in 1985, a move that severed his partnership with <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul
                    McCartney</a>.
                Jackson also flirted with becoming a movie star, working with
                George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 3D film Captain
                EO, shown only at Disney's IMAX theaters starting in 1986. Once
                this appeared, he started work on the task of following up Thriller.

                Working once again with <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, Jackson
                refined the
                Thriller template for 1987's Bad. Like Thriller, the first single was an
                adult contemporary number "l Just Can't Stop Loving You," a
                duet with then unknown <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siedah_Garrett">Siedah Garrett</a> before
                it cranked out
                hits: "Bad," "The Way You Make Me Feel," "Man in the Mirror," and
                "Dirty Diana" all reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100
                between 1987 and 1988, with "Another Part of Me" just missing the
                Top Ten and "Smooth Criminal" peaking at seven. Bad didn't
                dominate the charts in other countries but its singles reached the
                Top Ten internationally with some regularity, aided in part with a
                globe-spanning tour the first solo tour of Michael Jackson's
                career. The Bad World Tour broke records across the globe and in
                its wake, he started calling himself "The King of Pop," a nickname
                that was something of a retort to <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley">Elvis
                    Presley</a> being known as "The
                King of Rock & Roll." Once the tour wrapped up, Jackson returned
                to his new home a Santa Ynez ranch that he purchased in March
                1988 and renamed Neverland, playing up his Peter Pan fixation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackson renewed his deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony">Sony</a> the corporation that
                purchased <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records">Epic/CBS</a> in 1991 and then set to work
                on his next
                album. This time, he decided to part ways with <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy
                    Jones</a>,
                choosing to work with a variety of collaborators, chief among them
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Riley">Teddy Riley</a>, who helped usher Michael into the
                realm of new jack
                swing. "Black or White," the album's first video, caused some
                controversy, which helped generate initial press and sales and sent
                the single to number one. "Remember the Time" and "In the Closet"
                also made it into the Billboard Top Ten in early 1992, but
                subsequent singles "Jam" and "Heal the World" stalled in the low
                20s, while "Who Is It" made it to 14. Jackson's period of massive
                success was starting to end and, as it did, Jackson entered a rough
                personal period. In 1993, a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson of
                molestation. Over the next two years, the case played out in public
                and in the justice system, eventually settling out of court for
                undisclosed terms in 1995; no charges were ever filed. During all
                this, Jackson married <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Presley">Lisa Marie Presley</a>
                in May 1994; their
                marriage lasted just 19 months.

            <p>
                Jackson rebooted his career in 1995 with HIStory: Past, Present &
                Future, Book 1, a double-disc set divided into an album of hits and
                an album of new material. Preceded by a double-A-sided single
                containing the ballad "Childhood" and "Scream," a duet with his
                sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson">Janet</a>, the album underperformed
                compared to its
                predecessors but Still generated big hits, highlighted by "You Are
                Not Alone," the first single to debut at number one on the Billboard
                Hot 100. The subsequent singles "They Don't Care About Us" and
                "Stranger in Moscow" underperformed in the U.S. but were Top Ten
                singles in the U.K., and HIStory also did well in other global
                international markets, aided in part by the lengthy accompanying
                global tour. In 1997, Jackson followed HIStory with Blood on the
                Dance Floor, an album that topped the U.K. charts but only reached
                24 in the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
                By that point, Jackson had married his nurse, Debbie Rowe, who
                would soon become to the mother of two children: Prince Michael
                Jackson, Jr. and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Jackson">Paris Michael Katherine
                    Jackson</a>. Over the next
                couple of years, Jackson raised his family and performed at
                charitable events, starting work on a comeback planned for 2001.
                He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo act that
                year (<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jackson_5">the Jackson 5</a> had previously
                been inducted) and he staged
                two major 30th anniversary concerts in September 2001 to kick off
                the promo campaign for his new album, Invincible. Produced in
                large part by Rodney Jerkins, Invincible consciously evoked Off the
                Wall with its single "You Rock My World," which reached ten prior
                to the album's October release. Invincible entered the charts at
                number one in the U.S. and U.K., but it didn't have staying power
                and never generated another hit single.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, music took a backseat to Jackson's personal life. He had a
                third child, Prince Michael Jackson II in 2002, but the birth was
                overshadowed by erratic public appearances and legal problems,
                including an arrest in November 2003 for Child molestation; in
                June 2005 he was acquitted on all counts. As the case played out,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony">Sony</a> released the first-ever single-disc collection of
                Jackson's
                peak, Number Ones, in 2003; it had a new song, "One More
                Chance." Over the next few years, many catalog releases
                materialized: the 2004 box set The Ultimate Collection, the 2006
                double-disc set The Essential Michael Jackson, a collectors box
                called Visionary in 2006, and his catalog saw deluxe reissues in
                2008.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackson planned a major comeback for 2009 with a major tour
                called This Is It featuring a long run of shows at London's 02 Arena.
                As he was in the midst of rehearsals in Los Angeles, he collapsed at
                home on the afternoon of June 25, 2009. Rushed to the UCLA
                Medical Center, Jackson was pronounced dead of a cardiac arrest
                at the age of 50. An extensive investigation later named his death a
                homicide due to prescription drugs; Dr. Conrad Murray was
                convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn't take long for posthumous releases to begin to hit the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown</a> released The Remix Suite in October of 2009,
                shelves.
                and then a film documenting the 2009 concert rehearsals was
                released as This Is It, along with a soundtrack. Next came a DVD
                set called Vision, and 2010 brought Michael, a collection of
                outtakes, most dating from Invincible. In 2012, the 25th anniversary
                of Bad brought an expanded reissue of the 1987 album. <a
                    href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records">Epic</a>
                released Xscape in 2014, a record where L.A. Reid and <a

                reworked demos recorded between Thriller and Invincible.
                Preceded by the single "Love Never Felt So Good" an electronic
                duet with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> that went to
                the Top Ten Xscape
                earned gold certification. In 2016, Off the Wall received a deluxe
                reissue highlighted by an accompanying documentary directed by
                Spike Lee. Scream, a loosely Halloween-themed compilation,
                followed in 2017. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi
